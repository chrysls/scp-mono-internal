# Support

I checked this only with Windows 10.

But it should work with w7 also.


# Changelog


### V0.9


Last changes in game:

* Fixed fast shooting - **option removed from hack**
* Fixed item spawning method (this hack didn't have one and will not as it fixed :) )
* Fixed teleporting in most. You still can use intercom and teleport to your's class spawnpoint or exit pocket dimension through..

Changes in hack:

* Num6 = Change class (client-side) as SCP-(forgot number) - old man. (**EACH ABILITY IS WORKING IF YOU WAS ALIVE**)
* Num7 = Change class (client-side) as SCP-079 (**PLEASE DON'T USE IT'S NOT WORKING AS EXPECTED**)
* Num8 = Change class (client-side) as 1
* Num9 = Change class (client-side) as *too big for any class* (I'm not shure but sometimes that makes you invisible)

*So you can switch to OLD MAN SCP, go through the doors, teleport. And then switch back to class-D to use gun or pick item up.*

* Keyboard-1 = Force interaction command (works about 30% longer VS usual E). **works only with doors for now**
* Keyboard-2 = Force door block (from SCP-073) but that has no effect or I missed something..


### V0.8


* Num7 = Respawn as class D
* Num8 = Respawn as SCP 073
* Num9 = Dead but you will be 100% respawned ASAP.
* But keep in mind that respawn works OK only if you was alive. It will make you invisible and unable to damage players \ open doors \ etc if you was dead.
* Compiled hack uploaded (for quickstart)


### V0.7


* Mute menu (press F5).
* Fixed teleporting, it works much better


## Options

* ESP - press Left Alt to change esp mode (cards only, weapon only, ammo only, everything, nothing).

* Press X to teleport to exit from pocket dimension.

* Press M to teleport to Nine Tailed spawn.

* Press MOUSE3 (or even hold it) to enable noclip.

* ~~Press MOUSE4 to aimbot~~ (IT IS NOT WORKING).

* Press K to teleport at Intermission room (Press Q to use intermission)



**Options for small keyboard (numeric keyboard):**

* 0 = disable teleporting

* 1 = teleport at class D position

* 2 = teleport at scientist position

* 3 = teleport at SCP position

* 4 = teleport at 9tailed position

* 5 = teleport at MTF position



This teleport function will hardlock target till it alive.

If target is dead there will be a new search for the same type target.


**AND YES, YOU CAN AIM AT GROUND AND DESTROY EACH HEAD.** - still works.

But be carefull SCP can catch you this way..



Press F7 to make super fast reloading and super fast shooting.

Press F8 to make fast reloading and medium speed shooting.



Press keypad + / - to mute all players (it's not finished in this version of hack but I can update with mute-menu later).
